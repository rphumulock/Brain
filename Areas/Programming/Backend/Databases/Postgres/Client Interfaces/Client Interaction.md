### PSQL
>https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/app-psql.html

`psql` is a terminal-based front-end to PostgreSQL. It enables you to type in queries interactively, issue them to PostgreSQL, and see the query results. Alternatively, input can be from a file or from command line arguments. In addition, psql provides a number of meta-commands and various shell-like features to facilitate writing scripts and automating a wide variety of tasks.

- Can use `\timing` to find out query times for the client to receive the data.
