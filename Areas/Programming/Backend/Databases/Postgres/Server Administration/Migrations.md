Migrations should be coordinated with whatever API changes we make to be able to communicate with the new changes to the database.

---
### Schema Migration Example

Changes need to be done simultaneously otherwise you can have an API that refers to old bad data for the database or a database that has old bad data and the API is referring to the newer version. They must be coordinated.

### Schema Migration

Migration files are used that describe an UP - the changes you want to make as well as a DOWN Â - that describes how to undo this UP change.

Run `npm migrate up/down` to undo changes.

### Data Migration

Data Migrations should almost always be done via a transaction.

If we try to do everything in one step - we can get into some trouble.

If it takes time - things can happen with our data during that time. If new data is added but that new data takes on the old format - it will now be out of sync. We'd want to do it in a transaction but also be able to have data interactions still occur.

A solution is to do things piecemeal.
