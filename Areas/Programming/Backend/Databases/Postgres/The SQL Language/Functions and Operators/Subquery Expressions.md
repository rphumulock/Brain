Subqueries are queries that other parent queries refer to. It is vital to understand the shape of the subquery based off what it will return from it's verbs.

### Correlated Queries

Correlated queries are queries where the parent query is referred to in subquery. These are nested n$^2$ queries.

- CTE's can often be used instead and typically perform better
- It is useful to typically design the inner query first

###### Steps in below image:
1. Get all rows in first query and then begin to iterate over them
	- Start with first row from first query
2. Get all rows in second query and then begin to iterate over them
	- Compare first row to each row of second query and see if you keep that row
3. Restart with next row until all rows finished

### Subquery without a from

These are used for calculations typically
