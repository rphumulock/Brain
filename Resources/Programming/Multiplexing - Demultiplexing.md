### What is multiplexing?

Multiplexing, or _muxing_, is a way of sending multiple signals or streams of information over a communications link at the same time in the form of a single, complex signal. When the signal reaches its destination, a process called _demultiplexing_, or _demuxing_, recovers the separate signals and outputs them to individual lines.

Multiplexing is a method used by networks to consolidate multiple signals --digital or analog -- into a single composite signal that is transported over a common medium, such as a fiber optic cable or radio wave. When the composite signal reaches its destination, it is demultiplexed, and the individual signals are restored and made available for processing.

Networks use a variety of multiplexing techniques, but at a conceptual level, they all operate in a similar manner. The individual network signals are input into a multiplexer (mux) that combines them into a composite signal, which is then transmitted through a shared medium. When the composite signal reaches its destination, a demultiplexer (demux) splits the signal back into the original component signals and outputs them into separate lines for use by other operations.
